Description:
This study explores the use of explainable machine learning models to predict the quality of bulk-tank milk in sheep and goat farms, aiming to enhance dairy production practices.
By employing various machine learning algorithms, the research analyzes data from multiple sources, including environmental and operational factors, to provide actionable insights into milk quality.
The focus on explainability ensures transparency in the models' predictions, making them more accessible and useful to farm managers, fostering data-driven decision-making for improved quality control and operational efficiency.
