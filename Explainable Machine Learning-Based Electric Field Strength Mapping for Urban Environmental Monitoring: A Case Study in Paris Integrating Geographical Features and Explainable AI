Description:
This study explores the use of explainable machine learning models to map electric field strength in urban environments, aiming to improve environmental monitoring and urban planning practices.
By integrating data from various sources, including geographical features and urban characteristics, the research provides actionable insights into the factors influencing electromagnetic exposure.
The focus on explainability ensures transparency in the models' predictions, making them more accessible to urban planners and policymakers, and fostering data-driven decision-making for better public health and urban sustainability.
